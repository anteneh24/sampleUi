        <p>
          The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program is a lottery-style draw
          administered by the Department of State, where natives of countries
          with historically low rates of immigration to the United States are
          randomly selected for a diversity visa. There are a limited number of
          diversity visas distributed in any one fiscal year. For the DV-2020 US
          Visa Lottery there will be 50,000 such visas made available to natives
          from a number of different foreign regions, where 2020 refers to the
          year where successful entrants can enter the United States.

          What are your chances in the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program?
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a non-US national it is possible to obtain lawful permanent
          residence in the United States by entering the US Visa Lottery. While
          in no way guaranteed, the following guide tells you how to go about
          obtaining a lottery-style green card, courtesy of what’s officially
          known as the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program.

          Who is eligible to apply for the US visa lottery?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Enrolment into the US visa lottery is open to all individuals
          worldwide who meet the following two entry requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>• You must be a native of a qualifying country</li>
          <li>• You must meet an education or work experience requirement.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="mb-3">
        <h3 className="font-bold">Native Of A Qualifying Country</h3>
        <p>
          Under US immigration law, the list of eligible countries are limited
          to those from which fewer than 50,000 natives in various visa
          categories immigrated to the United States during the previous five
          years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list of eligible countries for each year’s US visa lottery is
          modified on the sole basis of this five year calculation, where people
          born in countries with high immigration rates are excluded from the
          program.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the US Visa Lottery DV- 2020 more than 50,000 natives of the
          following countries immigrated to the United States in the previous
          five years and, as such, are ineligible:
        </p>
        <p>
          Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China (mainland born), Colombia, Dominican
          Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria,
          Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, South Korea, the UK (except Northern
          Ireland) and its dependent territories, and Vietnam.
        </p>
        <p>
          A ‘native’ means someone born in a particular country, regardless of
          the individual’s current nationality or country of residence.
          Accordingly, eligibility is determined by the country of your birth,
          and not based on your country of citizenship or where you currently
          reside.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that you were born in one of the non-qualifying
          countries, you may in limited circumstances still be able to
          participate in the US Visa Lottery based on the country of birth of
          your parents or spouse.
        </p>

        <p>
          Applicants who are selected in the US Visa Lottery must still meet the
          strict eligibility requirements to go on to qualify for a diversity
          visa. However, you will only need to provide documentary proof of your
          native country, education and/or work experience if you are selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to immigrate, selectees must also be admissible to the United
          States. Both the online immigrant visa application form and the
          consular officer, during interview, will ask you questions about your
          eligibility to immigrate under US law, including questions about
          criminal and security related topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there is no fee to enter the US Visa Lottery, successful
          entrants who wish to apply for a visa must pay all application fees
          and associated costs for themselves and any qualifying family members.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must also prove that you will be able to support yourself and your
          family once you are living in the US, for example, in the form of
          personal assets, an affidavit of support from a relative or friend
          residing in the US, or an offer of employment from a US employer.
          Immigration under the US Visa Lottery does not entitle you to any
          financial or settlement assistance.

          Education Or Work Experience Requirement
        </h3>
        <p>
          Each US Visa Lottery entrant must also meet the education or work
          experience requirement by having either:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="">
            • Completed at least a US high school education or its foreign
            equivalent, defined as the successful completion of a twelve year
            course of formal elementary and secondary education, or
          </li>
          <li>
            • Obtained two years work experience within the past five years in
            an occupation that requires at least two years of training or
            experience. The US Department of Labor’s O*NET Online database will
            be used to determine qualifying work experience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There is no minimum age to apply for the US Visa Lottery, although the
          requirement of a high school education or work experience will
          effectively disqualify most persons who are under the age of 18.

          How do I apply for the US visa lottery?
        </h3>
        <p>
          To enter the US visa lottery you must do so via the Electronic
          Diversity Visa Lottery website (www.dvlottery.state.gov). The law
          allows only one entry per person during the registration period, where
          individuals who submit more than one entry will be disqualified.
        </p>
        <p>
          To complete your US Visa Lottery entry you must provide your personal
          and contact details. You must also list any eligible spouse and
          children under 21, unless they are already a US citizen or lawful
          permanent resident, regardless of whether they are living with you or
          intend to immigrate alongside you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Failure to list any eligible spouse or children, or listing someone
          who is not in fact your spouse or child, is grounds for
          disqualification. Although the US Visa Lottery is limited to one entry
          per person, each spouse may submit their own entry if each meets the
          eligibility requirements. If either spouse is selected, the other is
          entitled to apply as a dependant.
        </p>
        <p>
          All entrants must enrol with a recent visa-compliant photo, taken
          within the last six months, as well as a photograph of any eligible
          spouse and children. Submitting the same photograph that was submitted
          with a prior year’s entry will result in disqualification from the US
          visa lottery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having registered, you must print and retain your confirmation page so
          that you will be able to check your entry status online. It is crucial
          that you retain a record of your unique confirmation number, as this
          is the only way to check whether your entry has been selected. You
          will not otherwise be notified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Successful entrants will be directed to a confirmation page providing
          instructions on how to apply for a visa, including information about
          fees connected with that application.

        <p>
          Being randomly chosen in the US visa lottery does not guarantee that
          you will receive a diversity visa. Rather, selection means that you
          are eligible to apply for a visa, together with any qualifying family
          members.

          What are the odds for the US visa lottery?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The US Visa Lottery is drawn from random computerised selection from
          among qualified entries across six geographic regions, although no
          single country may receive more than 7% of the available diversity
          visas in any one year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the likelihood that some of the first 50,000 persons selected in
          the US Visa Lottery will not qualify for a diversity visa, or pursue
          their cases to visa issuance, more than 50,000 entries will be
          initially selected to ensure that the Department of State issues all
          available visas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of visas eventually issued to natives of each country will
          depend on the regional limits established, how many entrants come from
          each country and how many of the selected entrants are found eligible.
          However, all entries received within each region will have an equal
          chance of being selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each month, diversity visas will be issued to applicants who are
          eligible for issuance during that month, as long as visas are still
          available. Once all of the available visas have been issued, the
          program will end for that year. As visa numbers could be exhausted
          quickly, successful entrants should be prepared to act promptly.

          What are the timescales for the US visa lottery?
        </h3>
        <p>
          There is a limited timeframe each year to enter the US Visa Lottery.
          For the DV-2020 lottery the registration period ran from 3 October
          2018 to 6 November 2018, where no late entries will be accepted. Any
          new entrants will now need to wait until 2019 to apply for the US visa
          lottery DV-2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have applied for the US Visa Lottery DV-2020 you can check the
          status of your entry from 7 May 2019 onwards. Interviews will begin in
          October 2019 for successful entrants who have submitted all
          pre-interview paperwork and other information as requested in the
          notification instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selectees will be informed of their visa interview appointment through
          the online entry status check four to six weeks before their scheduled
          interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          All selectees, including family members, must be issued visas by 30
          September 2020. The Department of State will not be able to issue a
          diversity visa after this date, nor can family members obtain a
          diversity visa to join the principal applicant in the US after this
          date.
